**Code Description for Airbnb Data Cleaning and Exploration**

This code performs data cleaning, exploration, and transformation on the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset to prepare it for further analysis. Below is an outline of the steps taken:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - The necessary libraries (`pandas` and `numpy`) are imported for data manipulation and numerical operations.

2. **Loading the Dataset:**
   - The dataset `AB_NYC_2019.csv` is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

3. **Initial Exploration:**
   - Basic exploration is performed using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()` methods to understand the structure, data types, and summary statistics of the dataset.

4. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Missing values in the `reviews_per_month` and `last_review` columns are filled with `0`.
   - The presence of missing values in other columns is checked using `isnull()` and `isnull().sum()`.

5. **Correcting Data Types:**
   - The `price` column is cleaned by removing any potential symbols like `$` and converting it to a numeric type.

6. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - Duplicate rows are identified and removed to avoid redundancy in the dataset.

7. **Handling Outliers:**
   - Listings with unrealistic prices (`price >= 10,000`) are removed to ensure data consistency.

8. **Data Transformation:**
   - Categorical data in the `room_type` column is transformed into dummy variables using `pd.get_dummies()` to facilitate analysis.

9. **Saving Cleaned Data:**
   - The cleaned dataset is saved to a new CSV file (`cleaned_airbnb_listings.csv`) for future use.

This script effectively preprocesses the dataset, ensuring it is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis, such as modeling or visualization.
